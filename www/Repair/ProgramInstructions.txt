The experiment was tested on windows and mac computers using Firefox.

I reccommend installing a bug-catching program like firebug (in firefox, it's an 'add-on' you can download from the firefox website).  If the program crashes, and you have firebug turned on, it'll give the actual error output rather than us having to guess what went wrong.


Running an experiment:

Before you run the experiment, make sure you delete any files in the browser's cache.  This means the most recent version of the code and images will be loaded each time.  You can do this in Firefox by History > clear recent history > selecting 'cache' and 'offline data' and 'everything' and hitting "Clear Now".

If possible, connect to the network via an ethernet cable.  You'll need access to the whole internet, not just the intranet.  Turn all other internet-using programs off (email, other browsers etc.).

In Firefox, navigate both your computers to:

http://correlation-machine.com/LEX/IntroScreen.html

This will show a screen with some options for launching an experiment.

Choose Chain 1
From the parent column, choose the input language you'd like to use.  At the moment, there's a test language called 'CH1_G0_-1_1_1.lang' and some others.  THe other files are output files generated by previously run experiments (I've been running some just to test the program).  The file name gives information on when the experiment was launched:
CH{chain number}_G{Generation}-{Month}_{Day}_{Hour}{Minute}{second}

You can name the experiment anything you want, as long as the name starts with "CH1_G0" or "CH2_G0" etc.

For one computer, choose part1 (participant 1).  For the other, choose part2.

Choose a condition.

You'll see some stuff come up on the screen.  In the top left hand corner, there'll be an orange square.  For part 1, it'll say "Press to synchronise" and for part 2 it'll say 'waiting for part 1 to synchronise'.  Press the button on part 1's screen.  After a few seconds, the orange button should dissappear from part 2's screen.  The experiments are now synched and you can hand over to the participants.

I wouldn't set things up too early before the participants arrive. If there's a break in the network, or the program is running for a long time before starting (like, an hour), then the screens may become de-synchronised.

RUNNING MULTIPLE EXPERIMENTS AT THE SAME TIME

You can run multiple experiments on different chains.  However, the chain selection currently limits which starting language you can choose.  You can just make multiple copies of each starting language, with a "CH1","CH2","CH3" in front of each.  However, but if you're likely to want to run many experiments at the same time, let me know and I can make some changes.


LANGUAGE FILE

The language is specified by a tab delimited file ending in ".lang".  The first column specifies the image file location for the meaning.  The image location is relative to http://correlation-machine.com/LEX/Chat/  .  The best idea is to add image files to this directory (the folder  /www/LEX/Chat/images via FTP, see below).  Images are loaded as the program runs, so any changes you make will have an immediate effect (unless the browser is chaching images).  The second column specifies the string for the signal.   

e.g.

one	images/s1.png
two	images/s2.png
three	images/s3.png
...

The language files are stored on the ftp server at  /private/LEX/Experiments/ .  You can see some example language files here.

It's easy for me to change these files if you find it tricky.


RESULTS
The results of the experiment are stored in a location that's not accessible through a browser.  You'll need an FTP client (I use Yummy FTP for mac, but there are others e.g. cute FTP).  You'll need to log onto the correlation-machine and access files from there.

Navigate to /private/LEX/results
Note that there's another program called 'nemo' which has a very similar file structure to your experiment  - don't get confused!

Be careful!  Don't delete anything and you should be fine.

The results file is a tab delimited file with the following columns:

TargetMeaning	Context	ListenerResponse	SpeakerWord	TimeOfRoundCompletion	experimentName	experiment_filename	language_filename	speakerName	dictionary


e.g.:
0	6-0-7-8-1-9	0	one	6_12_2014_122940	CH1_G1-6_12_122310	CH1_G1-6_12_112316	CH1_G0-1_1_1.lang	Part2	one_two_three_four_five_six_seven_eight_nine_ten_eleven_twelve_thirteen_fourteen_fifteen_sixteen_


The dictionary is represented as a string of words seperated by "_" and lists the current state of the participant's dictionary in order of the language file meanings.
